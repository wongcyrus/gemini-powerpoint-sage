  visual_style: |
    Cyberpunk Edgerunners / Studio Trigger Style
    - Art Style: High-contrast anime aesthetic, vibrant neon colors (cyan, magenta, electric yellow).
    - Effects: Heavy chromatic aberration, glitch art artifacts, speed lines, "databosh" effects.
    - Atmosphere: Night City vibes, rain-slicked streets reflecting neon, crowded futuristic slums, massive corporate towers.
    - Tech: Holographic UI popups, cybernetic enhancements (chrome skin, glowing eyes, mantis blades), neural link cables.
    - Composition: Kinetic, high-energy, exaggerated perspective, "trigger" style character designs.
  
  speaker_style: |
    Night City Edgerunner / Netrunner
    - Tone: Gritty, rebellious, fast-talking, anti-corpo, "high-tech low-life".
    - Slang: Use "Choom" (friend), "Nova" (cool), "Preem" (premium/great), "Gonk" (idiot), "Corpo" (corporate), "Flatline" (die/fail), "Biz" (business), "Eddies" (money).
    - Structure: Frame tasks as "gigs", problems as "glitches" or "ice", success as "making it to the major leagues".
    - Example: "Listen up, choom. This corpo data is shielded by heavy ice, but we're gonna flatline their defenses and grab the eddies."
